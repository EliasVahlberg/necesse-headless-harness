#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs scenario files against a headless Necesse server and reports pass/fail per scenario.
#
# A scenario is a plain list of server console commands, one per line. Blank lines and
# lines starting with # are ignored. Because every line is just a console command, any
# prefix of a scenario can be pasted into an interactive server to debug a failure.
#
# Usage: run_scenario.sh [--keep] <scenario-file> [more-scenario-files...]
#
# Environment, all optional except MOD_UNDER_TEST when the layout is not the default:
#   MOD_UNDER_TEST=<dir>   directory holding the dev mod's jar, passed to -mod. Defaults to
#                          ./build/jar relative to where the script is run from, which is what a
#                          mod's own repository looks like.
#   SCENARIO_DIR=<dir>     where 'run <name>' looks for nested scenarios. Defaults to the
#                          directory of the first scenario file given.
#   HARNESS_WORLD=<name>   world to use. Must begin with a harness prefix; see the guard below.
#   HARNESS_DEADLINE=<s>   how long a run may take before the server is treated as wedged.
#   NECESSE_GAME_DIR=<dir> the game install, if it cannot be read from gradle.properties.
#
# THE KIT ITSELF MUST BE INSTALLED, not dev-loaded. The game accepts exactly one dev mod:
# DevModProvider.devMod is a single String, and LoadedDevMod.validateDevFolderAndReturnJar
# rejects a dev folder containing more than one file. The mod under test takes that slot, so the
# kit goes in the mods folder (~/.config/Necesse/mods), which DesktopPlatform's
# ModsFolderModProvider reads on dedicated servers too. 'make install' puts it there.
#
# --keep reuses the existing world instead of starting fresh. That is what makes persistence
# testable: one boot writes state and saves on shutdown, the next boot reopens the same world
# and asserts the state survived. Only persistence scenarios should use it -- every other
# scenario wants a known starting world.
#
# All scenarios share ONE server boot, because booting is most of the wall clock: a
# scenario's own work is a fraction of a second, while JVM start, mod load, world load and
# the shutdown save cost several seconds each time.
#
# Sharing a boot means scenarios are NOT isolated from each other, and that is the harness's
# sharpest edge. A scenario has to establish its own starting state; 'clear <radius>' covers a
# radius around spawn, which is not the same as covering the level, so an assertion that scans
# everything can still see what a previous scenario left behind. Mods with their own objects
# usually want a verb that removes all of them.
#
# Exit status is 0 only when the server started, every scenario ran, and none reported a
# failure. Assertion failures are recognised by the "FAIL" marker the mod's expect commands
# print.
