/**
 * A player on a dedicated server that has no player.
 *
 * <p>Half of this mod is a container UI, and a container is built from a player's inventory, so
 * the scenarios that exercise withdraw, deposit, quick stack and restock could only ever be run
 * by hand from chat. That is the least reliable part of the test suite: it is the part a person
 * has to remember to do.
 *
 * <p>The engine turns out to allow this. {@code NetworkInfo} is a four-method abstract class and
 * the game already ships {@link InvalidNetworkInfo}, whose {@code send} discards its bytes -- so a
 * client with no socket is a state the engine supports rather than a hole being punched in it.
 * {@code OneWorldMigration} constructs a {@code ServerClient} with a null {@code NetworkInfo}
 * during save migration, and singleplayer's local client legitimately has one too, which is why
 * {@code ServerClient.onFirstJoined} tests for {@code networkInfo == null}.
 *
 * <p>Everything outbound is therefore thrown away, which is correct: nothing is listening. What
 * matters is that inbound work runs the same server-side code a real client's packets would.
