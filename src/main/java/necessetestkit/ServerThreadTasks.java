/**
 * Runs work on the server thread, for callers that are not on it.
 *
 * <p>This exists because of a fault that took three server crashes to understand. Console commands
 * do not run on the server thread — {@code ServerScanThread} reads a line and calls
 * {@code CommandsManager.runServerCommand} directly, on its own thread. Anything that then mutates
 * the level is racing the tick, and the engine does not expect that: {@code Level.setObject} reaches
 * settlement data while holding a region lock, region *generation* takes the level monitor while
 * holding a region lock, and the tick takes those same pairs in the opposite order. Each inversion
 * was caught by the engine's own {@code ThreadFreezeMonitor}, which kills the server.
 *
 * <p>Two of them were fixed by taking the locks in the tick's order, which worked but was
 * whack-a-mole: it can only fix an inversion that has already been observed. The harness also spaced
 * commands apart, which looked like a fix and was not — removing the delay deadlocked reliably after
 * about a hundred commands, and merely shortening it still hung one run in three. A harness that
 * fails one run in three is worse than one that fails every time, because the silence in between
 * looks like success.
 *
 * <p>So the work is handed to the server thread instead, which is where the engine performs it and
 * where every lock order is consistent by construction. Nothing is being worked around any more.
